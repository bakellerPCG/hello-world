# hello-world
Just another repository - mine!   Beth Anne Keller, PCG

I am a former old mainframe dinosaur with COBOL, Asssembler training from bygone days at good ol' EDS.
However, I decided to focus on the business side of things and switched to focus on business Analyst.
Later joined Dataquest to serve Highmark/United Concordia before contracting with Technisource to work
as an Enterprise Business Analyst for United Healthcare.

Since 2013, I've worked for Public Consulting Group (PCG), a small but excellent public sector firm working
to serve my home state, the Commonwelath of Pennsylvania. As a consulting business vendor for the state, 
I've been A Business/Systems Analyst working for PA DHS under both the Educational side of house as well
as the Healthcare side of the house serving their MA Waiver consumers. 

Now, in June of 2021, I continue with PCG as a Sr. Business Analyst but I am returning to my rootes and 
working on developing my data analysis skills.   Starting with Python, then R, then who knows!

Educated at Shippensburg University, I started my professional life with a Mathematics BS Ed, and a 
Masters Degree in GeoEnvironmental Studies.  Yes, a nerd and tree hugger at the same time.

This is me.....be afraid, be very afraid :-)
